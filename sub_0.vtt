MR. INCREDIBLE:
You two, stay here.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.920

Should we be doing this?

01:58.080 --> 01:59.240
It is still illegal.

watch after Jack-Jack.

(VIOLET SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
TONY: <i>The girl, she's upset</i>

Hi.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.400
<i>I couldn't handle it</i>

02:37.760 --> 02:39.200
I feel kinda bad about it.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.000
Maybe I should've said
"hi" or something?

02:42.160 --> 02:44.120
It's not her fault
superheroes are illegal.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.120

I don't like strong girls.

Have you told anyone else
about this? Your parents?

02:52.760 --> 02:54.520
No, they'd only think
I was hiding something.

Sure, kid.

that from now on...

12:43.840 --> 12:46.720
The law should be fair.
What are we teaching our kids?

12:46.880 --> 12:47.880
To respect the law!

12:47.960 --> 12:49.560
Even when the law
is disrespectful?

12:49.720 --> 12:52.280
If laws are unjust,
there are laws to change them!

12:52.440 --> 12:53.560
Otherwise, it's chaos!

12:53.720 --> 12:55.600
Which is exactly
what we have!

13:01.760 --> 13:03.680
I just thought
it was kinda cool.

13:03.880 --> 13:07.560
What was?
Fighting crime as a family.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.480
(SIGHS) It was cool.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.800
But it's over.
The world is what it is.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.960
We have to adapt.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.720
Are things bad?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.360
Things are fine.

13:20.680 --> 13:21.800
May I be excused?

13:24.040 --> 13:25.440
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
How much longer
in the motel, Dad?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.760
Uh...
Not much longer, honey.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.080
HELEN: What are we
gonna do?

13:40.240 --> 13:41.680
BOB: I don't know.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.440
Maybe Dicker
will find something?

13:43.600 --> 13:44.920
Dicker is done, Bob.

13:45.080 --> 13:48.160
Any thought we had
about being Supers again is fantasy.

13:48.320 --> 13:49.880
One of us
has gotta get a job.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.160
One of us?

13:51.320 --> 13:53.280
You did a long stint
at Insuricare.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.040
Hated every minute of it.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.880
I know
it was hard on you.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.720
Maybe it's my turn
in the private sector

13:58.800 --> 13:59.800
and you take care
of the kids...

13:59.960 --> 14:02.920
No, I'm doing this.
I need to do this.

our house.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.600
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.200
We can't count
on anyone else now, Bob.

14:13.360 --> 14:14.520
It's just us.

you missed all the fun.

I know when to leave a party.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.360
I'm just as illegal
as you guys.

14:36.560 --> 14:39.080
Besides, I knew the cops
would let you go.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.760
Yeah, in spite
of Bob's best efforts.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.200
I heard
the program shut down.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.080
How much longer
are you in this motel?

14:47.280 --> 14:48.400
Two weeks.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.160
Now, you know
the offer still stands.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.560
You're very generous,
but there are five of us.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.280
We wouldn't do that
to you and Honey.

14:54.440 --> 14:55.880
Well, door's always open.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.200
You know,

14:58.360 --> 15:01.040

were being detained...

15:01.200 --> 15:04.800

who represents this tycoon.

15:07.080 --> 15:10.240
with me, with you two,
about hero stuff.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.600
LUCIUS:
I checked him out.

15:11.760 --> 15:12.840
He's legit.

15:12.920 --> 15:14.560
Trained under Dicker.
He wants to meet.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.760
Ah, jeez!
More superhero trouble.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.800
We just came from
the police station, Lucius.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.760
When?
Tonight. I'm going there now.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.400
You enjoy,
I'm sitting this one out.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.040
He wants
all three of us.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.720
Honey, let's just at least
hear what he has to say.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.360
You got the address,
I'll meet you guys there.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.520
Go in our Supersuits?

15:34.680 --> 15:35.960
Yeah.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.600
Might wanna wear
the old Supersuits.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.600
Got a feeling
he's nostalgic.

is especially good tonight.

My father was so proud

17:28.480 --> 17:31.520
that I was even remotely
connected to you guys.

He used to call you

She died
a few months later. Heartbreak.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.800
If superheroes had not been
forced underground...

18:34.960 --> 18:36.160
it never would've happened.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.640
Or Dad could've
taken Mom to the safe room

18:38.760 --> 18:39.840
as soon as he knew
there was trouble.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.440
I disagree strongly!

18:41.520 --> 18:43.480
But we're not going
into it right now.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.600
The point is...

18:45.760 --> 18:47.520
nobody expected us

18:47.600 --> 18:50.080
to be able to actually
run Dad's company.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.680
But with Evelyn as designer,
and myself as operator...

18:53.840 --> 18:56.240
uh, we threw ourselves
into building DEVTECH

18:56.360 --> 18:57.840
into what it is today.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.480

Perfectly positioned to make
some wrong things right.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.920
Hence, this meeting.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.520
Let me
ask you something.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.320
What is the main reason

19:10.400 --> 19:12.120
you were all
forced underground?

19:12.280 --> 19:14.240
Ignorance.
Perception.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.480
Take today for example,
with the Underminer.

19:16.640 --> 19:17.760
Difficult situation.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.240
You were faced
with a lot of hard decisions.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.480
Oh, tell me about it.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.880
WINSTON: I can't.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.360
Because I didn't see it...

19:25.520 --> 19:27.280
neither did anyone else.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.640
So, when you
fight bad guys like today...

19:29.800 --> 19:32.400
people don't see
the fight or what led up to it.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.720
They see
what politicians tell them to see.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.480
They see destruction
and they see you.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.320
So, if we wanna change

19:39.400 --> 19:41.640
people's perceptions
about superheroes...

19:41.800 --> 19:43.000
we need you

19:43.120 --> 19:45.440
to share your perceptions
with the world.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.480
How do we do that?
EVELYN: With cameras.

19:47.640 --> 19:51.560
<i>We need you</i>
<i>to share your perceptions</i> <i>with the world.</i>

19:51.720 --> 19:52.880
ELASTIGIRL:
<i>How do we do that?</i>

19:53.080 --> 19:55.080
EVELYN: We embed
tiny cameras, like those,

19:55.160 --> 19:56.360
into your Supersuits.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.640
Wow, so small.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.200
And the picture
is outstanding.

19:59.360 --> 20:00.800
Thanks!
Designed 'em myself.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.520
WINSTON: We've got
resources, lobbyists,

20:02.600 --> 20:03.960
worldwide connections...

20:04.120 --> 20:06.280
and very important,
insurance.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.680
Insurance is key.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.120
All we need now
are the super-est superheroes.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.560
It needs you three.
Come on!

20:12.720 --> 20:15.760
Help me make all Supers
legal again.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.400
This sounds great!

20:17.560 --> 20:19.480
Let's get this going.
What's my first assignment?

20:19.640 --> 20:21.640
That enthusiasm is golden.
(CHUCKLING)

20:21.720 --> 20:23.960
Now hold on to it.
But for our first move...

20:24.160 --> 20:26.960
Well, Elastigirl
is our best play.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.280
Better than me?
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:31.160 --> 20:32.680
I mean, she's good.

Really, a credit to her...

20:35.040 --> 20:37.640
You know.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) You know.

20:37.840 --> 20:38.880
With great respect...

20:39.040 --> 20:40.280
let's not test the whole

20:40.360 --> 20:41.960

20:42.120 --> 20:44.360
on the first
go 'round, okay? (FROZONE CHUCKLES)

20:44.440 --> 20:47.840
Wait a minute.
You're saying what? I'm messy?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.880
Well, Evelyn did
a cost-benefit analysis...

20:50.040 --> 20:52.280
comparing all your last
five years of crime fighting

20:52.360 --> 20:53.960
before going underground.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.960
And Elastigirl's numbers
are self-explanatory.

20:56.120 --> 20:58.040
Well, it's not
a fair comparison!

20:58.200 --> 21:00.760
Heavyweight problems
need heavyweight solutions.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.480
Of course!
We're gonna solve

21:02.560 --> 21:04.520
all kinds
of problems together.

21:04.680 --> 21:09.040
After the perfect launch
with Elastigirl!

21:09.880 --> 21:11.640
So, what do you say?

21:12.320 --> 21:14.640
What do I say?
(CHUCKLES)

21:15.600 --> 21:17.720
I don't know.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.600
What do you mean,
you don't know?

21:19.760 --> 21:21.920
A few hours ago,
you were saying it was over...

21:22.080 --> 21:24.200
and being a superhero
was a fantasy.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.200
Now, you get the offer
of a lifetime

21:26.280 --> 21:27.560
and you don't know?

21:27.760 --> 21:30.880
It's not that simple, Bob.
I wanna protect the kids!

21:31.040 --> 21:32.440
So do I.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.240
From jail, Bob!

21:34.400 --> 21:35.560
(SPITS)
BOB: And how do you do that?

21:35.720 --> 21:37.920
By turning down a chance
to change the law

21:38.000 --> 21:39.360
that forces them to hide
what they are?

21:39.560 --> 21:41.920
They haven't decided
what they are. They're still kids.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.440
Kids with powers,
which makes them Supers...

21:44.600 --> 21:46.880
whether they decide
to use those powers or not.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.160
This will benefit them.

21:48.360 --> 21:50.160
It's not a good time
to be away.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.760
Dash is having trouble
with homework...

21:51.920 --> 21:53.680
Vi is worried
about her first date

21:53.760 --> 21:55.040
with that boy she likes,
Tony...

21:55.200 --> 21:56.200
and Jack-Jack...

21:56.360 --> 21:58.160
Jack-Jack?
What's wrong with him?

21:59.120 --> 22:00.320
Okay, nothing's wrong
with Jack-Jack.

22:00.480 --> 22:03.040

from the grip and grins, you know?

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.600
Gotta get away
to keep it pure. I know I do.

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.360
What are you getting
away from?

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.680
Eh, you know, company stuff.
My brother, mostly.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.760
But you love him,
you two are this company.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:12:59.880
Yin and yang.

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:02.480
Yeah, I invent the stuff,
he's good at people.

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.760
Pleasing them, engaging them,
figuring out what they want.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.600
I never know
what people want.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.600
What do you think
they want?

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.240
Ease.

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:15.200
People will trade quality
for ease every time.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.520
It may be crap,
but hey, it's convenient.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.400
Yeah. Kind of
like this case.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.560
What?
The Screenslaver?

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:23.520
Yeah, something's not
sitting right.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.960
It was too easy.

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.520
That was too easy?
(CHUCKLES) Wow.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.360
Funny.
What?

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:31.960
Look at that.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.920
One of Screenslaver's monitors
is tuned into my suit cam.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.120
What?

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.120
Isn't the suit cam
closed circuit?

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.200
It is.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.720
Then how come
Screenslaver has it?

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.480
Maybe he hacked it?

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.000
So, he's sophisticated enough
to do that...

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.640
but he has simple locks
on his doors?

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.680
Maybe he wanted you
to find him.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.200
He wanted to get caught?

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.360
He wanted you to win.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.600
That makes no sense.
He's a brilliant guy.

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.080
If he's smart enough
to conceive

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.320
of technology like this...

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.000
he's smart enough to think
of something to do with it.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.040
The guy we put in jail
delivered pizzas.

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.120
So?

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.880
Einstein was
a patent clerk.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.080
Look, you won.
You got the guy who...

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.480
Wait. All Screenslaver
needs to do

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.640
to hypnotize someone...

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.880
is get a screen
in front of their eyes.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.040
But what if the screen
doesn't look like a screen?

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.720
What if the pizza guy
is really a pizza guy...

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.280
but he was controlled
by the screens

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:30.360
built into his glasses...

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.600
You are good.

JONNY QUEST: <i>Oh, I hope</i>

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.880
I thought it was best
to just let you sleep.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.120
Seventeen hours.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.760
How do you feel?
(CHUCKLES)

01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.360
Super.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.600

<i>Hurray!</i>

BOB: I can't tell you
how much I appreciate

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.600
you watching
Jack-Jack for me, E.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.720
Yes, I'm sure your gratitude
is quite inexpressible.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.560
Don't ask me
to do it again, darling.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.880
My rates are far too high.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.240
Oh, uh...

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.560
I am joking, Robert.
I enjoyed the assignment.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.440
He is bright
and I am stimulating.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.000
We deserve each other.

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.840
Your child is a polymorph.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:25.320
Like all babies,
he has enormous potential.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.080
It is not unknown
for supers

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:28.720
to have more
than one power when young...

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.560
but this little one
has many. (BABBLING)

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.640
Yes, you have many powers.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.200
(BABBLING)

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.560
EDNA: I understand
your lack of sleep

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.880
and coherency, Robert.

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.480
Babies can be anything,

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.080
and your child
is no exception.

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.960
He has pure,
unlimited potential, Robert.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.040
He slept while I worked
in a creative fever.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.680
Auntie Edna stayed up
all night...

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.360
making sure
you look fabulous in your many forms.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.880
What are you...
You're putting him in the...

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.240
In the chamber, Robert.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.000
He is part
of the demonstration

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.120
and will be fine.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.200
Your challenge
is to manage a baby

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.800
who has
multiple powers...

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.320
and no control
over them, yes?

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.520
Huh. That sums it up.

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:23.120
I often work to music

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.960
and I noticed the baby
responds to it as well.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.000
Specifically, Mozart.

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.800
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)
I blended Kevlar

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:31.720
with carbyne for
durability under duress...

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.800
and cotton for comfort.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:37.080
Interwoven with these fabrics
are a mesh of tiny sensors...

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:40.240
that monitor the baby's
physical properties.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:43.280
Oh, Lord! (STAMMERS)
What is he doing?

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:46.360
Well, it's Mozart, Robert.
Can you blame him?

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.600
The important thing is that
the suit and tracker...

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.720
anticipated the change
and alerted you.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.000
Oh, no. Cookies.

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.440
I gotta get cookies!

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.400
You do not need cookies.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.720
As I learned quite painfully

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.840
last night...

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.800
any solution involving cookies

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.640
will inevitably result
in the demon baby.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:03.720
(GROWLING)

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.920

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.120

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.200
(YELPS)

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.880
It means fire, Robert,

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:12.120
for which the suit
has countermeasures.

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:15.000
I suggest you extinguish
the baby's flames

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.000
before he trips
the sprinkler system.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.800
(BOB EXHALES)
The flame retardant

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:23.040

Effective, edible,
and delicious.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:29.320
Well, what do you know?
That is useful.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.240
Although, I have doubtlessly
exceeded your expectations

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.160
for a single night's work...

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.640
the suit
and device contain

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.680
a few more features
we need to discuss.

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.400
Thanks again, E,
for everything.

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:41.880
How much
do I owe you for...

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:44.880
Pish-posh, darling. Your bill
will be covered by my fee...

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.120
for being Mr. Incredible,
Elastigirl,

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.680

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:52.120
throughout the known universe
and until the end of time.

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.160
But babysitting this one...

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.120

<i>Why would you count on me?</i>
<i>Because I built you a bike?</i>
